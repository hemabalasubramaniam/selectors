                Natural resources are those resources that occur within the environment in their original and natural form,
                undisturbed by humanity. They take years to form without the intervention of humans.  
                Natural resources are materials or things that people use from the earth. There are two types of natural resources. 
                The first are renewable natural resources. They are called renewable because they can grow again or never run out. 
                The second are called nonrenewable natural resources. These are things that can run out or be used up. They usually come from the ground.

                <p>
                    The resources which cannot be exhausted even after continuous utilization are termed as renewable resources. 
                    Examples of renewable resources are the sun, wind, and tidal energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Non-Renewable resources
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The resources which cannot be immediately replaced once they are depleted are called Non-renewable resources. 
                    Examples of Non-renewable resources include fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas and rare minerals typically found in meteorites.
